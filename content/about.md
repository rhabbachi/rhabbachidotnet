## Where I am?

This is the blog of Riadh Habbachi. The goal of this blog to share some of my
advantures in technology and computers, having something to "report" to meight
help me keep my self motivated to try and learn new stuff and help conquere the
procastinator in me.

## What is this?
This blog is generated statiscally with [Hugo](gohugo.io). The theme is the
very elegante [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) from [@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo) (This is, right now,
hardcoded and meight be outdated and not true anymore. Until I learn how to
generate this from the configuration files).
