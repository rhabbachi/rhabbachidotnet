  In fashion people take you on your own estimation of yourself – that’s just a
  given. You can walk into a room feeling pumped up and confident, and if you
  radiate that the industry will believe in what you project. If, on the other
  hand, you appear vulnerable you won’t be seen as a winner. I remember a long
  time ago, when I was on maternity leave, Vogue employed a new fashion editor.
  When I met with my editor after having had my baby, she told me about her. She
  said, ‘Oh Lucinda, I’ve employed someone and she looked fantastic. She was
  wearing a red velvet dress and a pair of Wellington boots to the interview.’
  This was twenty years ago. She went on, ‘She’s never done a shoot before. But
  she’s absolutely beautiful and so confident. I just fell in love with the way
  she looked.’ And I went, ‘Ok, ok. Let’s give her a go.’ She was a terrible
  stylist. Just terrible. But in fashion you can go far if you look fantastic and
  confident – no one wants to be the one to say ‘… but they’re crap.’ Honestly
  Anja, you can go quite far just with that. Fashion is full of anxious people.
  No one wants to be the one missing out.

Stumbled on this interview titled `Will I Get a Ticket? A Conversation About
Life After Vogue With Lucinda Chambers
<http://vestoj.com/will-i-get-a-ticket/>`_. It struck me as who non challent
and honest it felt. I'm not really into fashion trends and I'm pretty sure
Vogue will not be my first choise from the pile of magazines in the doctor's
waiting room (usually there is always one).

What raisonated with me the most is the paragraphe that I quoted above, This is
not really tied to the fashing industry but this is generally how people behave
in life. I meight need to look any scientific researchs about this, but there
is this auro that radiate from confidant persons that helped people around into
folowwing them in their endavors.
