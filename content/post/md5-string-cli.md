While working on a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) integration. I needed
to generate a md5 hash of the test email address. Surprisingly enough, this was
not as intuitiv as I though it would be. Keeping a reference here for my future
self:

```sh
$ echo -n "myemailadress@example.com" | md5sum
```
