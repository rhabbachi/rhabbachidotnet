Just finished leading a CKAN workshop for 20+ public agents from various
governments agencies. Notable agencies includes the CNSS (Tunisian's Public
Social Security), INS, and Ministry of Transportation.

Training spawned over 2 days. Day one was for the CKAN setup. Day 2 was doing
more with extensions and advanced configuration.

Update: [Post on the OGP Tunisia website](http://www.ogptunisie.gov.tn/?p=3615).
