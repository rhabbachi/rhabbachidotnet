`45 Days — Chapter 1 — The Last Meeting in April
<https://medium.com/@liamboogar/45-days-chapter-1-the-last-meetings-in-april-fc02fc3ea49e#.f3ztxfvkg>`_

  “45 Days” is a non-fiction account of my experience as the Founder of Rude
  Media between May 1, 2016 and June 15, 2016. 45 Days was written starting on
  June 16th, initially as a therapeutic effort to process my experiences
  internally, as well as to try to distill down an experience that very few
  Founders have shared openly.

Just discovered this articles serie over at medium.com. The author (Liam
Boogar) is walking us through his last 45 Days of his company facing bankrupcy
and his last ditch efforts to save what could be saved and all the interaction
with the parties envolved (be it from within the company like the employees or
external like investors and potential acquieres).

For me I find those articles really interesting mainly for two reasons:

1. There is so much content about founding new startups and startups that do
   well (very well). All those blogs posts focus on how much money a startup
   raised, how many rounds of fund collection did happen, usually how big the
   new offices are and what 'starupy' stuff are available in there (ping-pong
   tables, poofs, fridge with free snacks). It's always about a high $$$ and
   big m2 but nothing or a passing mention about the team that helped bootstrap
   theis startups. Usually the articles about falling startups are very short
   and terse information wise. And it's the same short and cold story about a
   company failling for bankrupcy due to too much spending and failing to
   convert the investements into revenu and push the product to market. Those
   arctiles will always use the same figures and numbers from the previous
   article. This article serie is what I usually miss about those falling
   startups. Why the startup failled? What could the startup do to avoid this
   failing? What events lead to this inevitable conclusion? What did the team
   think of it? How did they react? What action did the startup founder do to
   avoid failling for bankrupcy? All of those questions are usually left out
   from the "startup X closing doors" type journalisme.

2. Listing the facts is one thing. Telling the story is something else. And
   Liam did a fantastic job telling the story of the last 45 days of his
   company. Alse he opted for a "time travel" style to his story (going back
   and forth between the present and the past) that made the story more
   immersive and captivating. It's like we are living his life, dabbing our
   feets in the waterpool in NY on the mairmade day but remembring the team
   meeting whene we annonced that the compary have only three months to
   survive.

The serie is still ongoing. And I'm really looking forward for the rest of the
articles.
