## Where I am?

My name is Riadh Habbachi and this is my blog. The goal of this blog to share
some of my advantures in technology and computers, having something to "report"
to meight help me keep my self motivated to try and learn new stuff and help
conquere the procastinator in me.

## What is this?

This blog is generated statiscally with [Hugo](gohugo.io). The theme is the
very elegante [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) from
[@mdo](http://twitter.com/mdo) (This is, right now, hardcoded and meight be
outdated and not true anymore. Until I learn how to generate this from the
configuration files).
